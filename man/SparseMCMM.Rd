\details{

Within the SparseMCMM framework, regularization techniques are employed to carry out variable selection, aiding in the identification of signature causal microbes. To account for the biases introduced by the regularization techniques employed, we further implement splitting strategy (Rinaldo et al; 2019), which can handle arbitrary penalties and provide asymptotically validated inference. Specifically, we randomly divide the dataset into two equal halves: the first half is utilized for variable selection, while the second half is dedicated to parameter estimation. The estimates of DE, ME, TE, and component-wise MEs were then calculated. We repeated this data splitting procedure multiple times (n.split times) to ensure robustness and accuracy in our estimations and inference.

If n.split > 1, the 'Esitmated Causal Effects' component is a 2 x 3 matrix. The first row contains the average estimates of DE, ME, and TE  based on n.split times of repetitions. Correspondingly, the second row provides the standard errors associated with these averages. If n.split=1,  the 'Estimated Causal Effects' component is a vector of length 3. This vector contains the estimates for DE, ME, and TE, which are calculated based on a single, random data split.

If n.split > 1, the 'Estimated component-wise Mediation Effects' component is a 3 x p matrix.  The first row contains the average estimates of compoment-wise MEs for all p taxa based on n.split times of repetitions. Correspondingly, the second and third rows provide the lower and upper 95\% confidence interval associated with these averages. If n.split=1,  the 'EEstimated component-wise Mediation Effects' component is a vector of length p. This vector contains the estimates for compoment-wise MEs which are calculated based on a single, random data split.
